Fix logout navigation, lobby state sync, and UI improvements

Android:
- Fixed logout navigation issue - now properly clears back stack and navigates to login
- Fixed leave lobby functionality - button updates immediately and state syncs correctly
- Fixed scroll issue in DetailsScreen - removed fillMaxSize() to allow proper scrolling
- Removed leave lobby button from ProfileScreen - replaced with active status indicator
- Added green 'Activ' status badge for future lobbies in ProfileScreen
- Fixed participant list refresh - lobby details now reload when screen is accessed
- Added cache control headers to prevent stale data in API requests
- Updated color palette to blue-violet theme (3C467B, 50589C, 636CCB, 6E8CFB)
- Improved DetailsViewModel to check participants list from API (source of truth)
- Added isLobbyDateInFuture utility function for status checking
- Enhanced DetailsScreen to reload lobby details on screen access

Bug Fixes:

- Scroll works properly even with many participants
- ProfileScreen no longer allows leaving lobbies, only shows active status
